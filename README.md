## Set up Angular locally

npx @angular/cli@17 new front-end --no-standalone

cd front-end

ng serve --open --configuration development

old commands:

ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json

npm start

http://localhost:4200/

## Set up nest server locally

nest new nest-proxy

cd nest-proxy

npm run start

http://localhost:3000/

Enable Hot Reloading (Optional)

npm run start:dev

Test the API

Test in ThunderClient or POSTMAN

## Connect to MongoDB ,install Mongoose:

npm install @nestjs/mongoose mongoose

##  Flow Overview
User submits a form in your Angular frontend (e.g., name, email, password).

Angular sends the data to the NestJS backend via an API (POST /users).

NestJS processes the request and stores the user in MongoDB.

MongoDB stores the user in a users collection.

NestJS returns a response to Angular, confirming the user was created.

CORS is enabled (app.enableCors()) in nestjs main.ts as 4200 port is calling 3000 port to connect to mongodb

## fully switch to Jest for unit testing

uninstall jasmine-karma

npm uninstall karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-coverage karma-jasmine karma-jasmine-html-reporter

then install Jest

npm install --save-dev jest jest-preset-angular @testing-library/angular @types/jest

npm install --save-dev @types/jest

npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom

run:

npm test

snapshot testing in jest (__snapshots__)  within the component folder itself

Remove all packages of jasmine karma before executing jest: npx jest

"@types/jasmine": "~5.1.0",

"jasmine-core": "~5.1.0",

## Jest snapshot testing

âœ… Avoids conflicts â€“ No mixing of render and TestBed.

âœ… Uses TestBed for all tests â€“ Consistent setup for regular and snapshot tests.

âœ… Manually extracts HTML â€“ Ensures snapshot testing without unnecessary test environments.

## Multer

Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, the enctype used for submitting forms with file uploads. It simplifies the process of receiving and processing file uploads in a web application by parsing the incoming data and allowing you to store files on the server's disk or in memory. Multer works with frameworks like Express.js and offers options for customizing storage, filtering file types, setting size limits, and handling errors.

npm install @nestjs/platform-express multer

npm install --save-dev @types/multer

# Generate a module named upload
nest g module upload

# Generate a controller inside upload folder
nest g controller upload

# Generate service
nest g service upload

ðŸ‘‰ Typically:

Controller = Handles incoming HTTP requests (/upload)

Service = Business logic (e.g., saving file metadata, uploading to S3, DB operations)

Module = Groups controller + service

## generate angular environments
ng generate environments
